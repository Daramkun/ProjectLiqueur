1. Vorbis# (csogg, csvorbis) (in Project Liqueur)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/mono/csvorbis

General Information
===================

This is Vorbis# version 0.1.

Vorbis# is a C# OggVorbis decoder written purely in C#.  It is 
based off of the Java version (Jorbis v0.0.12).

This code has been tested extensively with the mono JIT.  The
 MS will work as well, but you're on your own to use it to play
 sound in realtime (i.e., write your own audio backend).  Pnet
is untested completely.  Don't even try this with Rotor, unless
 you have a lot of time on your hands.
